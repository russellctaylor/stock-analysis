# Stock-Analysis

Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to make the code more efficient by using less memory, improving the logic and easier for future users to read.
Results
By refactoring the code using indexing the code ran way faster than the original code.  The coding using indexing must use less memory allowing the program to run around a second faster. 
Summary
There are advantages and disadvantages to refactoring code. It can make it easier for future users to read the code in addition to it running more efficiently.  It runs faster due to the fact the program references an index rather than searching for ticker symbols each time and must use much less computer memory.
